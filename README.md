# Coffe-Machine
The coffee machine first checked the raw materials it has to, and when the user makes an order, it will check what kind of coffee the user order, and if the raw materials 
are sufficient. If they are sufficient to make one, prompt the user to enter the amount of money the user wants to put in, and the machine determines if it needs to return
the changes to the user.
